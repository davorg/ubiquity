# Ubiquity commands

Can anyone remember what Ubiquity was? Google seems to have no knowledge of it.

I remember going to a lunchtime talk by someone who gave a demo of it. It was some kind
of browser extension that allowed you define commands that could be used to execute
browser actions. That seemed exciting, so I went straight back to my desk and wrote
these two plugins for it.

## Gumtree

This was my current client. They've completely rewritten their website at least once
since then, so I'd be astonished if the search command even worked on their current
site.

## LoveFilm

And they were my previous client. Of course, they were absorbed by Amazon. Their
DVD rental service was turned off and their fledgling VOD service eventually
became Amazon Prime Video. Their domain is still registered, but it no longer
responds to HTTP requests.

This repo is left here for archival (and, maybe, slightly sentimental)
reasons.
